## Introduction

Welcome to the User Management API documentation. This API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing user data, including retrieving user information, filtering users by various criteria, and sorting user lists.

The API is built using Spring Boot and follows RESTful principles. It uses Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation, ensuring that all endpoints are well-described and easily testable.

## API Endpoints

Here's a quick overview of the available endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/users/all` | Retrieve all users |
| GET | `/users/all/param/{param}/order/{order}` | Get all users ordered by a specific parameter |
| GET | `/users/{userId}/profile` | Get a specific user's profile by ID |
| GET | `/users/{country}` | Get users from a specific country |
| GET | `/users/{name}/{company}` | Get users by name and company |
| GET | `/users/email/{email}` | Get users by email domain |

## Getting Started

To use this API, you need to have:
1. Java 17 or higher
2. Spring Boot 2.5.0 or higher
3. Maven or Gradle for dependency management

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` or `gradle bootRun`
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Authentication

## Request/Response Formats

All responses are in JSON format. Here's a sample response structure for a user:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "company": "ACME Inc.",
  "username": "johnd",
  "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
  "address": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA",
  "zip": "12345",
  "state": "CA",
  "country": "USA",
  "phone": "+1 123-456-7890",
  "photo": "http://example.com/photo.jpg"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. In case of an error, the response will include a message describing the error.

Common error codes:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Rate Limiting
